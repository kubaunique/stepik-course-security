Injection is a type of vulnerability in applications in which an attacker can insert malicious code into a request to the server, and this code will be executed. The most common types of injections:

SQL Injection

Command Injection

HTML/JavaScript Injection (XSS)

LDAP Injection

 

Example: SQL Injection
Let's say we have a login form:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4860ce8-ccc6-48db-95d9-e461dbd918de)



And on the server, the code is something like this (in PHP):
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/865829da-3e43-4eb4-8dc5-2d2dca65496f)



Now imagine that an attacker enters a username in the field:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/897e5b72-1812-4623-9b39-1cbe2ae3b069)



And in the password — anything, for example: 123

The SQL query will become like this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb1437b1-6aa6-416f-9e66-b3744116095a)



'1'='1' is always true, and as a result, an attacker will gain access without a password.

How to protect yourself:
Use prepared statements.

Check and clear the input data.

Use ORMs or frameworks that do this automatically.



Broken Authentication is a vulnerability in which the authentication system is implemented with errors, which allows an attacker to hijack someone else's account. Reasons: simple passwords, lack of 2FA, incorrect implementation of sessions, etc.

 

Example: No restriction on login attempts
Let's say there is a login form:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ad6b615-1451-450d-9c83-cf7ab7bac8dd)


The server just checks the login and password.:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86ff807b-8d3d-4813-9d3c-2fba59a08009)



There is no password protection here. A hacker can write a script that will go through thousands of combinations for a single login and eventually find the right password.

 

What else could it be:
There is no 2FA — even if the password is stolen, an attacker will not log in with 2FA (for example, an SMS code).

Session tokens are predictable — for example, if token = session_12345, a hacker can simply change the number and get someone else's session.

The lifetime of a session is endless — a person has logged in once, and the session persists forever.

 

How to protect yourself:
Enable rate-limiting on login attempts.

It is mandatory to use two-factor authentication.

Use reliable session tokens (for example, UUID, JWT).

The session should expire automatically after a short period of inactivity.

Hash passwords using bcrypt, Argon2, etc.


Sensitive Data Exposure is a vulnerability in which sensitive information (passwords, card numbers, personal data) is transmitted or stored without proper protection, and an attacker can intercept or view it.

Example: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
Imagine that a user enters their bank card number on a website:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e6acb20-2d98-4a3f-94c5-b95148ea1ec6)


The request is sent over HTTP, not HTTPS:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea8f8351-50c0-4b2f-8d87-c4b52661fb8f)



If a user is sitting on a public Wi-Fi network (for example, a cafe), an attacker can use a sniffer (for example, Wireshark) and see this data in the clear.

 

Other typical errors:

Storing passwords in clear text in a database:

Storing card numbers without encryption.

Sending confidential information by email in clear text.

Using weak encryption algorithms, such as MD5.

How to protect yourself:
Use HTTPS in all parts of the application (including the API).

Encrypt data on the server and in the database (for example, using AES).

Passwords should be stored only as hashes with salt — bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2.

Do not log sensitive data.

Apply security policies: Content Security Policy, HSTS, secure cookies.



Broken Access Control is a vulnerability in which the system does not restrict users' access to resources or operations that they are not allowed to access. This can lead to the reading, modification, or deletion of other people's data.

 

Example: Direct URL Access (Insecure Direct Object Reference — IDOR)
There is a page on the website where the user can download their documents: GET /documents/12345.pdf

Let's say ID 12345 is a document of the Burul user. But the attacker Ruslan guessed to change the URL:GET /documents/12346.pdf

And if the server does not check who owns the file, Ivan will get access to someone else's document.

More examples of Broken Access Control:
An ordinary user sends a POST request to the admin/delete-user, and the system does not verify that he is not an admin.

The "delete product" button has been disabled in the mobile application, but the API still works using the DELETE /product/5 link, and it can be called manually.

Going to the page /admin-panel without checking the rights.

How to protect yourself:
Always check the user's rights on the server side, even if the interface hides the buttons.

Do not rely on data from the client (for example, the user_id from the form).

Use a role-based access model (for example, isAdmin, ownerId == userId).

Validation and authorization must be centralized and strict.

Test roles and access scenarios (for example, with Postman).



Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability in which an attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code into a web page, and this code is executed in other users' browser. This can lead to the theft of cookies, sessions, redirection to phishing sites, etc.

 

An example of an XSS attack:
There is a page with comments on the website. The server code simply outputs the entered text without verification.:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abdade0c-9dd8-4b69-864f-54b853d339a0)



If the user enters: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

The page will display:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8310489c-d382-47bb-a3aa-cefb70e3c3f1)



And this script will be executed for everyone who visits the page.

 

Consequences of XSS:
Theft of cookies (document.cookie)

Interception of keystrokes (keyloggers)

Phishing: substitution of shapes and elements

Executing malicious requests on behalf of the user

How to protect yourself:
Escape the HTML (for example, instead of < output <).

Use template libraries that do escaping by default.

Turn on the Content Security Policy (CSP).

Prohibit the insertion of HTML into fields where it is not needed.

Validate and clean up the input using libraries (for example, DOMPurify for JS).



CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack in which an attacker forces a user to perform an undesirable action on a trusted site where the user is already logged in.

The key is that the browser automatically sends cookies, even if the request was sent from another site.

Example: Forgery of a money transfer request
Let's say you are logged in to online banking on the website bank.com and at this time you visit another site, for example evil.com , which contains:

<img src="http://bank.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=1000" />

The browser automatically sends cookies because you are logged in bank.com , and the bank can make the transfer if there is no CSRF protection on the server.

In other words:
You clicked a button on the left site, and it triggered an action on another site on your behalf.

 

how to protect yourself from CSRF:

Use CSRF tokens in forms.

Check the Origin and Referer headers.

Set cookies with the SameSite=Strict or SameSite=Lax flag.

Use POST requests for critical actions (not GET).

Do not allow requests from external domains to be executed if it is not an API.

Use CAPTCHA for suspicious actions.

Use CSRF protection libraries (for example, csurf in Express, built-in protection in Django/Flask/Spring).

Store session tokens in HttpOnly and Secure cookies.



Security Misconfiguration is a situation where developers or administrators leave vulnerabilities due to incorrect or unsafe settings of an application, server, database, etc.

Example:
The application is running on the server with the administrator console enabled.:http://example.com/admin

Authentication is not configured — anyone who knows the URL gets full access.
Login: admin
Password: admin (default and has not been changed)

 

Other examples of Security Misconfiguration:
Access to .git/, .env or /config is open — you can download the configuration with passwords.

Error pages (500, 404) show the internal details of the system (call stack, file paths, etc.).

Debug mode is not disabled in the product: DEBUG=True

An outdated version of the framework is being used (for example, jQuery with a known XSS vulnerability).

API keys, passwords, and secrets are stored in the clear in code or uploaded to GitHub.

The server allows all traffic, all ports, no firewall rules.

How to protect yourself:
Delete or protect control panels.

Change default logins and passwords.

Turn off the debug mode on the prod.

Update software, frameworks, and dependencies.

Restrict access to configuration files.

Configure firewalls and minimize open ports.

Use security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.).

Scan the configuration regularly (for example, using OWASP ZAP, Nessus).
