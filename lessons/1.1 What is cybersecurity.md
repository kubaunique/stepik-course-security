In this lesson, you will learn what cybersecurity is, why it is important, and what types of information need to be protected. We will also look at how your online identity is formed and why it is a target for hackers.
1. Definition of cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is a set of measures and methods aimed at protecting computer systems, networks, and digital data from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. Its purpose is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of information.
2. Why is this important?

The growing number of connected devices: smartphones, smart homes, wearable gadgets â€” all this expands the "attack surface".

The value of data: personal information, commercial and government secrets, and financial transactions have high costs for intruders.

Economic and reputational risks: data leakage can lead to large financial losses, fines, and customer trust damage.
3. What is considered personal data?

Full name, date of birth, passport data

Logins, passwords, PIN codes

Financial information: bank card numbers, bank statements

Medical records: diagnoses, examination results

Personal correspondence, photos and videos

Cybercriminals can use this confidential information to identify you and impersonate you, violating your privacy and causing serious damage to your reputation.
4. Attack methods and examples

Phishing: fake emails or websites where you are asked to enter your username/password.
Example: you receive an email from "your bank" and click on the link, and the attackers steal your data.

Malware: viruses, Trojans, spyware.
Example: when downloading a "free" program, a keylogger is installed on your computer, which transmits passwords.

Web application vulnerabilities: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.
Example: On the online store's website, the raw data from the order form allows the attacker to gain access to the user base.
5. Basic principles of protection

Software Update: Install patches and security updates in a timely manner.

Strong passwords and 2FA: Use long passwords and two-factor authentication.

Encryption: Store and transfer data only over secure channels (HTTPS, VPN).

User education: beware of suspicious emails, check website addresses and download source.
