1. Introduction

 

Authentication and authorization are two key processes in web application security. These concepts are often confused, but it is important to understand that these are different stages.:

Authentication is the confirmation of the user's identity.
Authorization is the verification of the authenticated user's access rights.

2. Authentication

 

The goal: To make sure that you are you.

Basic authentication methods:

By knowledge (what you know):
Passwords
PIN codes
By ownership (what you have):
SMS codes
Token generators (for example, Google Authenticator)
Devices with chips
By Biometrics (who you are):
Fingerprints
Face, iris of the eye
 

 

Enhanced authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication, TFA):

Combines two or more methods. For example, a password + an SMS code.


3. Authorization

Purpose: To determine what the user can do.

Types of authorization models:

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): access by roles (admin, user, etc.)
ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control): access by attributes (time, IP, status)
ACL (Access Control List): the list of rights for each resource
 

 

Example:

The user is logged in to the site (authentication), but only the administrator is allowed to change the settings (authorization).


4. Threats and mistakes:

Using simple or identical passwords
Lack of MFA
Errors in the authorization logic (for example, URL crawling)
Leakage of toxins and sessions

5. Best practices:

Always use MFA
Hashing passwords (for example, with bcrypt)
Check authorization at every level (including on the server)
Use secure frameworks and libraries
