Getting an SSL code
Option 1: Let's encrypt (if there is a domain)
sudo apt installs cert bat python 3-certbot-nginx
sudo, which performs the verification

Option 2: Self-signed certificate (for training)
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -365 days -new RSA key:2048\
--input /etc/ssl/private/nginx-self-signed.key \
-output /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt

Configuring Nginx Configuration
Create or open a file: sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
And add it to the server section:
listen 443 ssl;
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;

location / {
    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html;
}

Also add a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS:
server {
    listen 80;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}  
Check
Restart the server:
sudo systemctl restart ngin

Check in the browser: https://localhost
Or in the terminal:curl -I https://localhost --insecure

At this stage, you have configured your server with HTTPS support!
This is the first step towards securing web applications at the infrastructure level.
