Personal data is any information that allows you to directly or indirectly identify a person. Such data includes:

Last name, first name, patronymic

Phone number and e-mail

Passport and identification data

Medical information

1)Medical records

Every time you visit a doctor, information about your physical and mental health is added to your Electronic Medical Record (EHR). Since most of these records are stored online, it is important to be aware of what medical information you provide.

Moreover, such records go beyond the doctor's office. For example, many fitness trackers collect large amounts of medical data, such as:

heart rate

blood pressure

blood sugar levels

This data is transmitted, stored, and displayed through cloud services. Therefore, it is worth considering them as part of your medical records, and treat them with the same care and responsibility.

2)Educational records

Educational records contain information about your academic qualifications and achievements. However, they may also include:

your contact information

attendance data

disciplinary reports

medical and immunization records

records of special education, including Individual Educational Programs (IEP).
3)Labor and financial records

Labor data can be valuable to hackers if they can gather information about your past work or even current reviews of your activities.

Your financial records may include information about your income and expenses. Your tax documents may contain salary information, credit card statements, your credit score, and bank account information. All of this data, if not properly protected, can violate your privacy and allow cybercriminals to use your information for their own purposes.

What are the dangers of leaks?
Identity theft: A fraudster may take out a loan for you or use your profile for criminal purposes.

Financial losses: access to bank accounts, cards, or payment services.

Medical fraud: an attacker receives treatment or medications at your expense, which spoils your health.the story.

Reputation damage: especially critical for public figures or employees in certain fields.

How are we protected?
Many countries have laws on personal data protection, for example:

GDPR (EU) is one of the strictest and most respected data protection standards.

The Law on Personal Data in the Kyrgyz Republic regulates the collection, processing and storage of personal data.

However, no law will protect your data if you don't follow the basic rules of digital hygiene yourself.

Remember:
Your data is your responsibility. Before sharing information, think about it: is it really necessary?
