HTTPS, Cookies, and session security
The Internet seems simple: you enter your username and password, click the button, and log in to the site. But what happens "under the hood"? And how to protect this data transfer from hackers and leaks?


HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that is used to securely transfer data between the browser and the server. Unlike HTTP, HTTPS encrypts all information that you send or receive.

HTTPS is based on the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol, which:

Encrypts the data so that no one can read it along the way.

Verifies the authenticity of the server so that you know exactly who you are communicating with.

Guarantees the integrity of the data so that an attacker cannot replace them.

Example: You go to the bank's website and enter your details. If the site is running over HTTPS, the data is encrypted, and even if someone intercepts your traffic, they will only see encrypted "garbage".

What are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files that a website stores in your browser. They help:

Stay logged in,

Save user settings,

Track activity (including in analytics and advertising).

However, cookies, especially those used for authentication (such as session_id), can be the target of attacks if not properly protected.  

Threats caused by incorrect cookie settings
XSS (Cross-site scripting)
An attacker can inject JavaScript that reads the cookie if it does not have the HttpOnly flag.

Going to an unencrypted page (HTTP)
Without the Secure flag, even an important cookie can be transmitted in clear text.

CSRF (Cross-site request forgery)
Without properly configuring SameSite, an attacker can send a request on behalf of the user without his knowledge.

How to stock up on cookies?
It is recommended to specify which cookies would be harmless.:

 

The Destination flag
Secure access to cookies via HTTPS only
HttpOnly Opens cookies in JavaScript
On the same site, you can set up cookie serving only with your sites.
 

The first option of a safe cookie:

 
session ID=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict

Conclusion
Using HTTPS and setting cookies correctly is a necessary minimum for protecting modern web applications.

These technologies are not just "recommendations", but the basis of digital security: protecting your passwords, bank data, personal messages and confidential information.
