What's it?
Broken Access Control is a situation in which users can perform actions for which they do not have the appropriate rights. This is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities according to the OWASP Top 10 version, because it allows an attacker to gain access to confidential data, change other people's records, or even gain administrator rights.

Examples:

A user with the user role gets access to admin-level pages by changing the URL:
/admin/settings

The ability to change the user_id in a request and get someone else's information:

GET /account?user_id=1234
The absence of repeated rights verification on the server side, when verification is only available on the frontend (in JavaScript).

Using predictable IDs, for example, /orders/101, /orders/102.

Facebook (2015)
Hackers could delete user photos by sending a special request with the required photo_id. Problem: the server did not check who owned the photo.

Instagram (2020)
The security researcher was able to access the private stories of other users through a direct link, even if he was not signed up.

Why does this happen?
Developers rely on JavaScript control (web interface).

The rights checks are only in the UI or at one point in the code.

Static paths or parameters are used that can be guessed or changed.

How to protect yourself?
Check access on the server on every API request.

Implement a role model (RBAC) or an access policy (ABAC).

Use invisible identifiers (for example, UUIDs instead of consecutive IDs).

Make sure that you can't change other people's data, even if you know the URL.

Conduct automated tests and code reviews.

"Never rely on client access checks. In web applications, anything that you haven't checked on the server can be bypassed. The most dangerous mistakes are often not related to technical complexity, but to incorrect access control logic."
