Web applications used by billions of people around the world may contain various vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access or malicious actions. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is an organization that publishes a list of the most common threats to web applications. In this lesson, we will look at the 5 most dangerous threats and ways to protect against them.
SQL Injection
What's it?
SQL injection is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities that allows an attacker to insert malicious SQL code into a database query. This can lead to the disclosure of confidential data or even a complete loss of control over the database.

Example of vulnerable code (PHP):
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_POST['username'] . "' AND password = '" . $_POST['password'] . "'";
Attack: If the attacker enters in the username field:
' OR '1'='1
The SQL query becomes like this:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = ''

 

This request always returns true, which allows an attacker to bypass authentication.

How to protect yourself?

Use prepared statements that prevent injections.

Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) or frameworks that automatically process parameters.

Clear and validate all input data.

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
What's it?
XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page. When another user visits this page, the script is executed in their browser.

Example of vulnerable code:

echo "<h1>Hello, " . $_GET['name'] . "!</h1>";

If the attacker enters name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>, the page will display a pop-up window.

How to protect yourself?

Escape all input data before output (use htmlspecialchars).

Apply the Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script execution.

Command Injection
What's it?
Command Injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server through vulnerable input fields.

Example of vulnerable code (PHP):

$command = "ping " . $_GET['host']; $output = shell_exec($command); echo $output;

If the attacker passes the value localhost; rm -rf / in the host parameter, the server executes the command to delete all files.

How to protect yourself?

Do not transfer data from the user to the system commands.

Use libraries and functions that restrict access to the operating system.

LDAP Injection
What's it?
LDAP injection allows an attacker to manipulate requests to an LDAP server (systems for storing and searching data). This may lead to the disclosure of confidential information or a breach of system security.

Example of vulnerable code:

$ldap_query = "(&(uid=" . $_GET['username'] . ")(userpassword=" . $_GET['password'] . "))";

If an attacker enters username=*))(&(|(user password=, the request can be manipulated to return all users or provide access to the data.

How to protect yourself?

Use the parameters in LDAP requests to avoid manipulation.

Clear and validate all input data.

Security Configuration (Configuration Errors)
What's it?
Configuration errors are incorrect settings of servers, databases, or applications that may become vulnerable to attacks. These can be open ports, unreliable passwords, or access to administrative panels.

Example of a vulnerable configuration:

Open ports on the server that are not in use.

Enabled debugging messages on the production server.

Systems and applications that have not been updated.

How to protect yourself?

Apply the principle of least privilege.

Keep the software updated constantly.

Check the security configuration regularly.
