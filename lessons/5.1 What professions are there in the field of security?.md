Cybersecurity is an area aimed at protecting computer systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. In today's world, almost any company, from a startup to a global corporation, needs security specialists.

The cybersecurity market is actively growing: according to reports from ISC2 and Cybersecurity Ventures, global security spending is expected to exceed $300 billion by 2025.

Due to the increasing number of threats, data leaks and attacks, the demand for specialists is steadily growing. More than 3 million cybersecurity jobs have already been opened worldwide.

Work in this field may include:

Web Application Protection
Vulnerability detection and elimination
Incident monitoring and response
Development of security strategies and policies

What qualities are important to a specialist

Who are SOC analysts?

A SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst is a specialist who works in the company's security monitoring center and constantly analyzes events in order to find and prevent cyber attacks.

What does a SOC analyst do?

Monitors network traffic and security events in real time.
Detects suspicious activity and potential incidents.
Conducts an initial investigation of incidents (for example, who tried to attack, how and through what).
Transfers serious cases to the next level of response (sometimes to the incident response team — the IR Team).
Configures security systems: SIEM systems (Security Information and Event Management), IDS/IPS (systems for detecting and preventing attacks).
Skills that a SOC analyst needs:

Knowledge of networking and operating systems (Windows, Linux).
Understanding threats and attack methods (for example, phishing, malware, man—in-the-middle (MITM) attacks).
The ability to work with SIEM platforms (for example, Splunk, IBM QRadar, ArcSight).
Basic scripting skills (e.g. Python, Bash) for automating tasks.
An example of a SOC analyst's working day:

In the morning: check the SIEM dashboards for new incidents.
During the day: investigate suspicious events.
In the evening: update the threat detection reports and rules.
Briefly:

The SOC analyst is the company's "first line of defense" against cyber attacks. They are the ones who first notice the strange activity and start the protection process.

What do pentesters do?

Penetration testers are specialists who simulate cyber attacks on systems in order to identify vulnerabilities before they are discovered by intruders. Their work resembles that of "ethical hackers."

The main tasks of pentesters:

Perform penetration tests on web applications, networks, and servers.
Identify vulnerabilities: SQL injection, XSS, server misconfiguration, etc.
Create reports on vulnerabilities found and make recommendations for their elimination.
Use tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Metasploit.
Work within the framework of pre-agreed rules so as not to cause harm.
Example:

The penester checks the website of the online store. It finds an XSS-type vulnerability that allows you to inject a malicious script into product comments. He then writes a risk report and helps the developers fix the problem.

A brief summary:

Pentesters help companies stay one step ahead of hackers by identifying weaknesses in system security.

Application Security Engineer

An application security engineer is responsible for developing, verifying, and improving the security of software products at all stages of their creation, from design to release.

What does an application security engineer do?:

Analyzes the code for vulnerabilities (for example, through static code analysis — SAST).
Creates recommendations for developers: how to write secure code.
Conducts an audit of the application architecture.
Configures secure development processes (Secure SDLC).
Implements automatic security testing tools.
Monitors the application's compliance with the requirements of standards, for example, OWASP Top 10, PCI DSS, GDPR.
Example:

The security engineer checks the new module of the banking application and finds that requests to the server are not being validated. He gives recommendations to developers to add data filtering and implements automatic verification of input parameters.

A brief summary:

Application security engineers prevent the creation of vulnerabilities even at the development stage, and not after the application gets into the hands of users.

Security Consultant

A security consultant is a specialist who evaluates, recommends, and helps implement best cybersecurity practices in companies.

What does a security consultant do?:

Evaluates the current security level of the organization.
Develops a plan to improve data protection and infrastructure.
Advises on the implementation of security standards (for example, ISO 27001, NIST).
Trains company employees in the rules of safe work.
Helps to organize a security audit and pass certification.
In case of an incident, it helps to investigate the causes and suggests solutions to eliminate problems.
Example:

The company is preparing to work with international clients. The security consultant helps to organize the protection of personal data in accordance with GDPR requirements and set up incident management processes.

A brief summary:

Security consultants are strategists in the cybersecurity world. They help companies not only eliminate vulnerabilities, but also build a stable and reliable protection system for the future.

Risk Manager

A cybersecurity risk manager is a specialist who evaluates threats and develops strategies to minimize them.

What does a risk manager do?:

Identifies possible threats to the company's information systems.
Evaluates the probability of each threat and its potential damage.
Develops a risk management plan: how to prevent, minimize, or eliminate them.
Creates an incident response policy.
Conducts regular audits and analyzes weaknesses in the company's security.
Maintains reports and interacts with other departments to improve the overall level of security.
Example:

The risk manager analyzes that the lack of backup of client data can cost the company millions. He develops a plan for regular backup and recovery of information in case of emergency.

A brief summary:

Risk managers help companies not only detect hazards, but also plan actions to reduce the consequences of attacks or failures.

How to build a career path in cybersecurity

A career path in cybersecurity typically evolves from basic technical roles to more strategic and managerial positions.

How growth is usually built:

The initial stage
Assistant Security Specialist, Junior SOC Analyst, information security technical support.
Tasks: incident monitoring, basic threat analysis, assistance in incident response.
The average level
Pentester, threat analyst, application security engineer.
Tasks: conducting penetration tests, developing secure software, protecting corporate systems.
Senior Specialist
Senior Security Engineer, Security Solutions Architect, Incident Manager.
Tasks: managing large projects, developing a defense strategy, and coordinating teams.
Management level

Tasks: full responsibility for protecting the company's data and systems, interacting with top management, and developing a security policy.
Development features:

Continuous growth is important: obtaining certifications (for example, CompTIA Security+, CEH, CISSP).
Constant updating of knowledge about new threats.
The ability to switch between specializations (for example, from SOC to pentesters or vice versa).
Result:

In cybersecurity, you can build a career from a beginner to a CISO-level manager if you constantly study, gain experience, and develop skills in dealing with risks and people.
