What is pentesting?
Penetration testing (ethical pentest) is a controlled, authorized simulation of an attack on a web application or system in order to find vulnerabilities before attackers do so.

The difference from malicious hacking:

The pentest is conducted with the written permission of the owner.

Reports are kept and recommendations for correction are given.

The main stages of the pentest
Reconnaissance
Collection of publicly available information: IP ranges, domains, technologies.

Scanning
Automated vulnerability detection (OWASP ZAP, Nmap).

Exploitation
Checking whether it is really possible to exploit the vulnerability (XSS, Sql, etc.).

Maintaining access (Post-Exploitation)
Analysis of the consequences of access: escalation of privileges, script pavilion.

Report (Reporting)
Documenting the problems found and recommendations for their elimination.

Tools
OWASP ZAP: A web vulnerability scanner with a graphical interface.

Burp Suite: interactive proxy scanner.

Nmap: Network scanning of ports and services.
