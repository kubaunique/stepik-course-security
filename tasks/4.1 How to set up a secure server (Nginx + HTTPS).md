1)You're setting up a secure server with HTTPS. Here is the current Nginx configuration:

server {
    listen 443;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}

However, when restarting the server, an error appears and HTTPS does not work.

Question:
What needs to be fixed in the configuration to make HTTPS work?

 


a.Delete location block

b.Specify listen 80 instead of 443

c.Add the ssl directive to the line listen 443 ssl;  TRUE

d.Reverse the order of ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key
